I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:47.093
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:49.094
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:50.685
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.486
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:54.855
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:58.492
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.495
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:02.697
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.499
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.467
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.539
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.586
What is she saying?

28
00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.724
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:33.729
That's Jameson.

30
00:04:57.517 --> 00:04:59.017
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.454
I'm awake.

32
00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:02.888
Missed me.

33
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.589
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:06.824
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:09.861
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:12.363
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.666
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:16.935
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:18.571
My meeting?

40
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:20.438
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.342
My meeting.

42
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:28.848
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.750
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:30.752 --> 00:05:32.652
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:34.486
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:34.488 --> 00:05:37.423
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:39.859
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:41.427
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:42.929
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:44.664
That's hot.

51
00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.566
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:47.867
I will.

53
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.401
I love you!

54
00:05:49.403 --> 00:05:51.004
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:06:58.508 --> 00:06:59.774
How'd she do?

76
00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:02.711
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:04.712
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:04.714 --> 00:07:06.183
You told me what?

79
00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:08.151
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

82
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.594
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:20.197
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:23.098
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.669
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:28.038
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.672
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:31.708
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.910
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.613
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:37.981
Uh...

92
00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:39.983
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:39.985 --> 00:07:41.684
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:44.087
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.524
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:50.527
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:52.931
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:57.867
He's a crook.

99
00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:01.071
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:03.242
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:06.177
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:07.945
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:07.947 --> 00:08:11.015
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:12.717
All right, all right.

105
00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:17.088
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.756
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:20.558
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.093
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:25.062
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:26.265
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:28.699
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.134
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:31.803
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:33.005
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:34.206
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.208
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.677
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.711
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:43.949
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:46.018
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.886
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:49.955
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:51.590
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:54.059
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:57.163
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:59.931
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:08:59.933 --> 00:09:01.667
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:03.469
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:04.770
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:06.172
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:08.708
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.010
I was going places.

133
00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:12.111
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:12.113 --> 00:09:13.880
I was going places.

135
00:09:13.882 --> 00:09:15.715
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:15.717 --> 00:09:18.584
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:21.322
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:24.827 --> 00:09:26.994
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:28.262
Let's just get the check.

140
00:09:55.892 --> 00:09:57.993
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:43.674
Shh.

142
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.258
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.827
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.097
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:10.799
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.935
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:15.205
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.407
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:19.809
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:22.879
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.814
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.850
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.493
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.121
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.191
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.126
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:39.063
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.830
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:40.832 --> 00:11:42.199
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.401
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.436
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.804
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.007
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.310
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.780
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:57.661
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:11:57.685 --> 00:11:59.486
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.453
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:03.490
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.024
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:09.827
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.330
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:11.332 --> 00:12:13.397
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.067
But it's okay.

175
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:18.103
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:20.104
All right, you create

177
00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.807
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.476
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:23.478 --> 00:12:25.480
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:27.482
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:27.716 --> 00:12:30.015
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:31.850
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:33.453
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:33.455 --> 00:12:35.388
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.955
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:38.390
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:40.326
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:42.829
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:44.329
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:46.165
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:47.966
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:49.167
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.504
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:52.805
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:52.807 --> 00:12:54.407
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:56.409
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:58.344
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:01.415
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:03.250
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:05.251
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:06.854
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:06.856 --> 00:13:08.354
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:10.425
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:12.860
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:15.062
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:16.397
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.964
end up killing people.

208
00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:19.467
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:19.469 --> 00:13:20.834
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:22.269
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.836
Sorry?

212
00:13:23.838 --> 00:13:25.973
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:25.975 --> 00:13:27.908
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.243
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:30.844
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:32.846
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:32.848 --> 00:13:34.516
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:34.518 --> 00:13:36.216
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:36.218 --> 00:13:37.485
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:39.287
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:40.155
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:41.021
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:41.023 --> 00:13:41.889
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:43.527
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:49.196
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:49.198 --> 00:13:51.866
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:51.868 --> 00:13:53.901
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:56.441
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:03.878
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.617
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:08.584
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.151
We do the work.

233
00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:12.624
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:12.857 --> 00:14:14.924
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:18.260
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.201
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:28.204
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:30.609
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:30.843 --> 00:14:32.724
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:35.479
Hey.

241
00:14:35.481 --> 00:14:37.481
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:37.483 --> 00:14:39.014
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.049
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.118
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.353
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:46.525
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:48.495 --> 00:14:50.562
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:51.997 --> 00:14:53.399
You used me.

249
00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:03.443
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:38.078
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:41.415 --> 00:15:43.216
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:42.270
Test 36.

253
00:17:42.272 --> 00:17:43.806
Biological interactions

254
00:17:43.808 --> 00:17:46.141
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:46.143 --> 00:17:48.745
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:48.747 --> 00:17:50.780
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:50.782 --> 00:17:52.615
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:52.617 --> 00:17:53.818
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:17:54.052 --> 00:17:55.586
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:17:55.588 --> 00:17:57.555
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:00.191 --> 00:18:01.794
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:07.198 --> 00:18:08.299
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:14.473 --> 00:18:17.373
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:19.846
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.813
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:25.381
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:29.252
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:29.254 --> 00:18:33.557
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.258
"We"?

270
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.394
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:37.396 --> 00:18:39.362
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:39.364 --> 00:18:40.798
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.300
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:43.302 --> 00:18:44.983
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:46.838
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.708
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:50.744 --> 00:18:52.243
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:53.380
Good work.

279
00:19:15.703 --> 00:19:16.837
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:20.806
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:24.443
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:26.155
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.213
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:29.683
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:29.685 --> 00:19:31.382
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:31.384 --> 00:19:32.919
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.923
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:36.158 --> 00:19:37.624
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:38.927
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:41.530
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.933
I used to be.

292
00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:46.833
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:49.469
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:52.440
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:53.840
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:19:53.842 --> 00:19:55.810
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:19:55.812 --> 00:19:57.844
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:19:57.846 --> 00:19:59.846
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.318
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.955
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.959
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:14.327
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:14.329 --> 00:20:16.464
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.466
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:21.268
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.739
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:23.741 --> 00:20:24.806
You did that for me?

308
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.408
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:27.944 --> 00:20:30.479
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:32.914
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:32.916 --> 00:20:34.582
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:34.584 --> 00:20:37.317
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.789
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:39.422 --> 00:20:40.555
Deal.

315
00:20:40.557 --> 00:20:42.457
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:46.293
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:48.597
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.866
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:50.868 --> 00:20:52.868
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.037
You look like shit.

321
00:20:54.939 --> 00:20:56.438
Excuse me?

322
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.808
You look like shit.

323
00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:02.011
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:02.013 --> 00:21:04.746
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:04.748 --> 00:21:06.616
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:06.618 --> 00:21:08.618
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.752
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:10.754 --> 00:21:13.956
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:16.759
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:18.494
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:19.662
That is the problem.

332
00:21:24.636 --> 00:21:27.537
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:29.939
Please.

334
00:21:29.941 --> 00:21:31.406
Let's go.

335
00:21:31.408 --> 00:21:33.088
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:35.714 --> 00:21:38.949
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:41.051
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:42.755
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:02.042
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:04.043
It just does.

341
00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:24.394
I gotta go.

342
00:22:24.396 --> 00:22:28.467
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:31.873 --> 00:22:33.105
What a dick.

344
00:23:02.637 --> 00:23:04.471
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:04.473 --> 00:23:06.005
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:06.007 --> 00:23:07.473
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:07.475 --> 00:23:08.942
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:08.944 --> 00:23:10.943
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:16.784 --> 00:23:17.850
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:17.852 --> 00:23:19.721
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:25.727 --> 00:23:31.164
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:35.001
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:35.003 --> 00:23:37.470
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:37.472 --> 00:23:39.106
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:39.108 --> 00:23:42.843
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.846
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:45.848 --> 00:23:47.481
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:07.004 --> 00:24:09.737
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:14.176
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:14.178 --> 00:24:15.845
History starts now.

361
00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.547
This is day one.

362
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:21.817
This is first contact.

363
00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:24.186
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:37.034 --> 00:24:39.170
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:43.507
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:52.248
Put me through.

367
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.085
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:24:56.521 --> 00:24:57.887
There's no need.

369
00:24:57.889 --> 00:25:00.923
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:00.925 --> 00:25:02.959
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.094
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:05.096 --> 00:25:07.830
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:07.832 --> 00:25:11.000
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:11.002 --> 00:25:13.069
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:16.142
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.680
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:23.682 --> 00:25:25.015
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:25.017 --> 00:25:29.820
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:29.822 --> 00:25:32.723
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:32.725 --> 00:25:34.191
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:34.193 --> 00:25:36.328
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:36.562 --> 00:25:39.630
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:39.632 --> 00:25:41.265
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:44.301
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:46.839
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:52.843
We will.

387
00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:55.916
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:25:58.251 --> 00:25:59.319
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:02.223 --> 00:26:03.223
Open it.

390
00:26:16.204 --> 00:26:18.303
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:18.305 --> 00:26:20.039
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:22.208
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.361
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:42.363 --> 00:26:45.065
- Where the hell did it go?
<i>- Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:46.635
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.805
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:30.813 --> 00:27:32.115
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:01.177 --> 00:28:03.879
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:05.280
I was...

400
00:28:05.282 --> 00:28:08.016
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:08.018 --> 00:28:12.187
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:17.496
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.294
I mean...

404
00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:21.099
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.169
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:28.106
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:31.073
Okay.

408
00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:33.142
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:34.478
I need your help.

410
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.179
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.914
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.916
We're done.

413
00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.518
No...

414
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.854
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.923
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:48.258
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.792
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:51.861
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:54.197
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.033
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:28:56.035 --> 00:28:58.102
and they are dying.

422
00:28:58.104 --> 00:29:00.203
They are all dying.

423
00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:01.774
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:03.943
Come here.

425
00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.177
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:08.345
Because it's true.

427
00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:10.114
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:10.116 --> 00:29:12.049
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:14.219
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.582
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:15.788 --> 00:29:17.087
I can't do that.

432
00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:18.890
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:20.525
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:20.527 --> 00:29:22.193
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:22.195 --> 00:29:23.862
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:23.864 --> 00:29:26.064
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:26.066 --> 00:29:28.434
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:28.436 --> 00:29:31.201
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:33.507
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:37.042
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:37.044 --> 00:29:39.344
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:39.346 --> 00:29:42.415
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:42.417 --> 00:29:44.450
I am.

444
00:29:44.452 --> 00:29:46.452
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:47.919
because I am done.

446
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:49.289
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:50.158 --> 00:29:51.524
What shit?

448
00:29:51.526 --> 00:29:54.493
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:29:54.495 --> 00:29:56.064
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:15.249 --> 00:30:16.250
Eddie?

451
00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:18.620
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:18.854 --> 00:30:21.887
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:23.222
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:23.224 --> 00:30:24.991
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:24.993 --> 00:30:26.595
Eddie...

456
00:30:26.829 --> 00:30:28.429
This is Dan.

457
00:30:28.431 --> 00:30:30.465
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.199
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:33.842
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:33.869 --> 00:30:34.934
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:34.936 --> 00:30:36.937
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:39.272
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:39.274 --> 00:30:41.478
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:42.378 --> 00:30:43.912
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:47.448
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.170
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:51.053 --> 00:30:52.955
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:30:59.995 --> 00:31:02.165
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:05.534
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:11.005
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:11.007 --> 00:31:13.408
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.612

from being any of your business, right?

Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:19.884 --> 00:31:22.216
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:22.218 --> 00:31:24.185
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:24.187 --> 00:31:26.223
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:27.591 --> 00:31:29.223
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:29.225 --> 00:31:30.660
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:30.662 --> 00:31:32.428
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.129
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:35.532
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:37.669
You look good, by the way.

doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:39.103 --> 00:31:40.183
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:41.272 --> 00:31:43.171
A lot.

486
00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:44.574
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:44.576 --> 00:31:47.142
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488

I can't really believe
that we're not...

No, we can't.

503
00:33:43.432 --> 00:33:45.398
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.435

away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:48.437 --> 00:33:51.270
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:51.272 --> 00:33:53.372
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:53.374 --> 00:33:55.241
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:55.243 --> 00:33:57.377
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:57.379 --> 00:34:00.447
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:34:00.449 --> 00:34:03.283
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:34:03.285 --> 00:34:05.587
A comet?

512

of life, of millions of organisms.

513

Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:10.594 --> 00:34:12.392
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:12.394 --> 00:34:13.830
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:14.064 --> 00:34:16.464

Yes.

520
00:34:22.104 --> 00:34:23.305
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.174
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:29.845
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:29.847 --> 00:34:34.315
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:34.317 --> 00:34:37.184
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:37.186 --> 00:34:41.657
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.156
So they can live in space?

527

We call them hosts.

528
00:34:44.594 --> 00:34:47.395
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

00:42:56.802 --> 00:42:58.122
Eddie, Jesus!

627
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:00.105
This is dead.

628
00:43:00.773 --> 00:43:02.073
Dead.

629
00:43:02.075 --> 00:43:03.707
Eddie, sit down.

630
00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:05.676
Okay, all right. Okay.

631
00:43:05.678 --> 00:43:07.244
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

632
00:43:07.246 --> 00:43:08.880
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

633
00:43:08.882 --> 00:43:10.014
Put it down. Eddie!

634
00:43:10.016 --> 00:43:12.050
Snap out of it!

635
00:43:13.953 --> 00:43:15.086
No.

636
00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:16.854
All right. It's no good.

637
00:43:16.856 --> 00:43:18.289
Bobby,
are you all right?

638
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:19.426
- Hey!
- Whoa!

639
00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:21.325
Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:43:21.327 --> 00:43:22.407
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

641
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.963
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

642
00:43:25.965 --> 00:43:27.165
Are you hurt?

643
00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:28.400
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

644
00:43:28.402 --> 00:43:30.101
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

645
00:43:30.103 --> 00:43:31.702
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

646
00:43:31.704 --> 00:43:33.138
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

647
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.706
- No.
- Eddie, please.

648
00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:35.807
Oh, my God.

649
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:38.076
Ah.

650
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:44.283
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

651
00:43:44.285 --> 00:43:46.363
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

652
00:43:46.387 --> 00:43:48.053
Patient.

653
00:43:48.055 --> 00:43:49.721
Oh, it's much better.

654
00:43:49.723 --> 00:43:51.123
You are insane.

655
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.638
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

656
00:43:52.662 --> 00:43:54.059
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

657
00:43:54.061 --> 00:43:55.227
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

658
00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:57.763
And I have proof!

659
00:43:57.765 --> 00:43:58.997
Ugh.

660
00:44:05.272 --> 00:44:07.909
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

661
00:44:13.048 --> 00:44:14.249
Eddie.

662
00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:16.850
Eddie?

663
00:44:17.986 --> 00:44:19.321
Eddie, can you hear me?

664
00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:21.909
This is Dan speaking to you.

665
00:44:23.158 --> 00:44:25.825
Hey, Dan.

666
00:44:25.827 --> 00:44:27.294
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Where am I?

667
00:44:27.296 --> 00:44:28.762
<i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i>

668
00:44:28.764 --> 00:44:30.330
<i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i>

669
00:44:30.332 --> 00:44:33.100
- Where is Anne?
- <i>Anne is not here right now.</i>

670
00:44:33.102 --> 00:44:34.504
<i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i>

671
00:44:34.737 --> 00:44:36.003
<i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i>

672
00:44:36.005 --> 00:44:37.838
<i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i>

673
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.509
<i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i>

674
00:44:40.743 --> 00:44:41.809
<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>

675
00:44:48.017 --> 00:44:49.350
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

676
00:44:49.352 --> 00:44:50.951
<i>Eddie, you okay?</i>

677
00:44:55.224 --> 00:44:56.957
Shut it down.

678
00:44:56.959 --> 00:45:00.027
Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:45:00.029 --> 00:45:01.228
You're okay. Yeah.

680
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.365
Coming out. You all right?

681
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.965
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

682
00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:06.468
- You okay?
- Yeah.

683
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.403
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

684
00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:10.405
Yeah.

685
00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:12.206
<i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i>

686
00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:14.042
I get claustrophobic, too.

687
00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.546
Dr. Lewis?

688
00:45:15.778 --> 00:45:17.912
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:17.914 --> 00:45:19.482
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:22.553
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.732
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:24.756 --> 00:45:26.821
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:26.823 --> 00:45:28.524
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:28.526 --> 00:45:30.125
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.194
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:33.828
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.263
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.832
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:38.167
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:39.809
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:43.305
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.540
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:46.208
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.815
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.154
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:58.156 --> 00:45:59.591
Everything was fine.

707
00:45:59.825 --> 00:46:02.427
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:46:02.429 --> 00:46:05.429
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:06.963
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:06.965 --> 00:46:08.332
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:10.535
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:10.537 --> 00:46:11.577
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:12.905 --> 00:46:14.239
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:18.578 --> 00:46:20.898
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:22.147 --> 00:46:25.148
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:27.588
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:29.088 --> 00:46:30.887
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:32.329
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:33.192 --> 00:46:35.125
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:35.127 --> 00:46:37.161
Such poor design.

721
00:46:37.163 --> 00:46:39.996
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:39.998 --> 00:46:41.266
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:44.037 --> 00:46:45.639
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:47.575
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:58.318 --> 00:46:59.653
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:02.053
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:47:02.055 --> 00:47:03.955
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:47:03.957 --> 00:47:06.157
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:07.459
Thank you.

730
00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:09.026
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:09.028 --> 00:47:11.600
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:16.538 --> 00:47:18.638
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.641
Excuse me.

734
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.045
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:27.047 --> 00:47:30.016
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:30.018 --> 00:47:31.686
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:35.020
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:35.022 --> 00:47:36.658
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:36.893 --> 00:47:38.625
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:38.627 --> 00:47:40.225
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:44.097
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:44.099 --> 00:47:45.998
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.367
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:49.002
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:49.004 --> 00:47:51.237
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:51.239 --> 00:47:53.139
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:55.074
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:55.076 --> 00:47:58.211
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:58.213 --> 00:48:00.246
but super, super fast?

750
00:48:00.248 --> 00:48:02.015
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:48:02.017 --> 00:48:03.383
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:48:03.385 --> 00:48:05.251
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:48:05.253 --> 00:48:07.421
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:07.423 --> 00:48:10.323
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:10.325 --> 00:48:12.292
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:12.294 --> 00:48:13.627
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:15.196
- Yes.
<i>- Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:15.198 --> 00:48:17.701
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:17.935 --> 00:48:19.600
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:19.602 --> 00:48:22.136
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:22.138 --> 00:48:23.605
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:23.607 --> 00:48:25.507
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:28.409
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:43.694 --> 00:48:45.160
Yeah?

765
00:48:45.162 --> 00:48:46.803
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:46.964 --> 00:48:48.698
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.198
Whatever.

768
00:48:53.135 --> 00:48:55.136
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:55.138 --> 00:48:57.578
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:48:59.577 --> 00:49:02.079
I was troubled by

771
00:49:03.113 --> 00:49:04.715
what we've been doing.

772
00:49:04.717 --> 00:49:06.516
I get it.

773
00:49:06.518 --> 00:49:07.785
I get it.

774
00:49:09.052 --> 00:49:10.487
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.057
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:14.692 --> 00:49:17.763
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:19.464 --> 00:49:20.765
I need that from you.

778
00:49:23.769 --> 00:49:26.302
I can't do that.

779
00:49:26.304 --> 00:49:29.742
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:32.043
your friend.

781
00:49:33.378 --> 00:49:35.111
The person who was here.

782
00:49:35.113 --> 00:49:37.114
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:39.651
You know that, right?

784
00:49:39.653 --> 00:49:42.151
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:42.153 --> 00:49:44.424
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:47.459 --> 00:49:49.094
Hey. Dora.

787
00:49:50.696 --> 00:49:53.567
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:49:56.803 --> 00:49:58.103
Will you trust me?

789
00:50:05.077 --> 00:50:06.644
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:06.646 --> 00:50:07.814
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:17.457 --> 00:50:19.159
You were our best.

792
00:50:19.759 --> 00:50:21.493
Open it.

793
00:50:25.633 --> 00:50:26.832
No! No!

794
00:50:26.834 --> 00:50:28.836
No! No! No!

795
00:50:33.674 --> 00:50:35.443
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:37.078 --> 00:50:38.276
Huh?

797
00:50:50.758 --> 00:50:52.826
Stay put.

798
00:50:52.828 --> 00:50:54.694
- Hey, Eddie.
<i>- Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:50:54.696 --> 00:50:56.898
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:50:57.164 --> 00:50:58.832
Whoa.

801
00:50:58.834 --> 00:51:01.601
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:51:01.603 --> 00:51:03.302
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:51:03.304 --> 00:51:05.605
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:51:05.607 --> 00:51:08.575
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:08.577 --> 00:51:09.878
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:11.511
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:11.513 --> 00:51:13.213
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:13.215 --> 00:51:15.214
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:15.216 --> 00:51:17.417
- Eddie...
<i>- I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:17.419 --> 00:51:19.318
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:21.124 --> 00:51:22.124
Take him down.

812
00:51:33.301 --> 00:51:34.704
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:43.246 --> 00:51:45.915
- What is that?
<i>- Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:47.617 --> 00:51:48.751
Oh.

815
00:51:58.261 --> 00:51:59.262
Shit.

816
00:52:21.185 --> 00:52:23.518
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.554
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:25.556 --> 00:52:26.655
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:26.657 --> 00:52:29.461
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:36.701 --> 00:52:38.302
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:43.975 --> 00:52:45.910
No! No, no, no!

822
00:52:52.685 --> 00:52:54.717
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:52:54.719 --> 00:52:56.988
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:53:05.664 --> 00:53:08.000
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:08.234 --> 00:53:09.668
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.540
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:16.542 --> 00:53:17.976
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:17.978 --> 00:53:19.979
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:21.714 --> 00:53:22.980
Treece...

830
00:53:22.982 --> 00:53:24.985
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.694
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.738
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.840
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:48.842 --> 00:53:50.408
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:51.445
"Parasite"?

836
00:53:58.653 --> 00:54:00.721
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:06.692
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:06.694 --> 00:54:08.494
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:10.896
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:10.898 --> 00:54:12.399
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:20.842 --> 00:54:22.909
What?

842
00:54:22.911 --> 00:54:25.376
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:25.378 --> 00:54:27.913
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:27.915 --> 00:54:29.016
Launch the drones.

845
00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:00.513
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:55:01.885 --> 00:55:03.517
Whew!

847
00:55:03.519 --> 00:55:05.421
- Thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:13.630
Oh!

849
00:55:21.771 --> 00:55:24.251
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:30.981 --> 00:55:32.715
Oh, God, no!

851
00:55:54.939 --> 00:55:56.738
Holy shit!

852
00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:06.015
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:56:06.017 --> 00:56:08.486
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:14.591 --> 00:56:16.728
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:19.531
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:27.072 --> 00:56:28.073
What the...

857
00:56:34.747 --> 00:56:37.049
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:41.219 --> 00:56:42.220
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:45.591 --> 00:56:46.711
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:48.661 --> 00:56:50.997
No!

861
00:57:10.851 --> 00:57:12.819
- That is a dead-end!
<i>- Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:14.521 --> 00:57:16.623
Whoa!

863
00:57:22.796 --> 00:57:23.797
Yeah!

864
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:54.929
Whoa!

865
00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:03.202
I am going to die!

866
00:58:03.204 --> 00:58:04.640
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:16.718 --> 00:58:19.021
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:28.565 --> 00:58:29.830
I got him.

869
00:58:29.832 --> 00:58:30.897
<i>- Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:30.899 --> 00:58:32.835
This is incredible.

871
00:58:39.141 --> 00:58:42.043
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:42.045 --> 00:58:45.081
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:58:56.893 --> 00:59:00.862
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:59:00.864 --> 00:59:03.333
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:13.978 --> 00:59:15.910
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:15.912 --> 00:59:17.080
Get off the car!

877
00:59:33.864 --> 00:59:34.900
My legs.

878
00:59:37.169 --> 00:59:39.034
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:39.036 --> 00:59:41.439
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
00:59:56.788 --> 00:59:58.721
What the hell
are you?

881
00:59:58.723 --> 01:00:01.191
I am Venom.

882
01:00:01.193 --> 01:00:03.960
And you are mine.

883
01:00:03.962 --> 01:00:06.329
You bit somebody's head off.

884
01:00:06.331 --> 01:00:08.399
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:08.401 --> 01:00:10.436
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:10.671 --> 01:00:12.903
You did not find us.

887
01:00:12.905 --> 01:00:15.475
We found you.

888
01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:17.741
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:19.009
Where are you going?

890
01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:22.112
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:22.114 --> 01:00:24.081
You remember him.

892
01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.482
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:27.985
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:29.820
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:29.822 --> 01:00:32.256
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:32.258 --> 01:00:34.826
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:39.398 --> 01:00:42.167
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:42.169 --> 01:00:43.468
Most likely.

899
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.935
Oh, God.

900
01:00:44.937 --> 01:00:47.939
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:47.941 --> 01:00:51.245
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:00:52.412 --> 01:00:54.515
That is the deal.

903
01:00:58.018 --> 01:00:59.351
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:00:59.353 --> 01:01:01.253
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:01:01.255 --> 01:01:03.296
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:25.978
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.812
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:29.884
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:33.219
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:33.221 --> 01:01:36.389
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:38.124
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:39.925
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:39.927 --> 01:01:41.563
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.368
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:57.244
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.414
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:03.420
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:05.488
The arrogance.

919
01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:15.464
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:17.600
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:22.235
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:29.243
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.346
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:32.414
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.349
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.250
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.952
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:38.988
Bodies?

929
01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.392
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:47.362
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:49.298
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.636
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:53.435
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.070
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:56.573
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:02:56.575 --> 01:03:00.109
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:01.910
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.856
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.615
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:03:05.617 --> 01:03:07.916
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.486
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:09.488 --> 01:03:12.055
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:12.057 --> 01:03:13.658
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
<i>- No!</i>

944
01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:15.357
- Eddie?
<i>- No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.392
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:16.394 --> 01:03:17.662
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:17.896 --> 01:03:19.962
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:21.331
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.502
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:23.435 --> 01:03:25.935
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:25.937 --> 01:03:28.238
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.174
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:31.176 --> 01:03:33.477
<i>- Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:33.479 --> 01:03:35.479
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:37.548
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:39.048
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:40.584
<i>- "We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:40.586 --> 01:03:42.666
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:44.356 --> 01:03:46.191
Yeah.

960
01:03:52.063 --> 01:03:54.500
- Shit.
<i>- You want up?</i>

961
01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:00.607
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:11.418 --> 01:04:13.720
Hmm.

963
01:04:13.953 --> 01:04:17.154
- It is peaceful up here.
<i>- I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:17.156 --> 01:04:21.359
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.698
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:23.932 --> 01:04:25.096
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:35.072
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:47.385
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:48.490
Whoa.

970
01:04:53.963 --> 01:04:57.531
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:04:57.533 --> 01:04:59.666
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:02.068
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.571
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:05:04.573 --> 01:05:06.473
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:05:06.475 --> 01:05:09.476
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:09.478 --> 01:05:11.645
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:11.647 --> 01:05:13.114
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:14.783
Thank you.

979
01:05:18.654 --> 01:05:19.688
Okay.

980
01:05:21.658 --> 01:05:23.157
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:27.095 --> 01:05:28.296
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.467
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:42.579 --> 01:05:43.713
Hands!

984
01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.383
On the ground! Now!

985
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:54.622
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:05:54.624 --> 01:05:56.691
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:05:56.693 --> 01:05:59.192
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:05:59.194 --> 01:06:00.831
- Mask!
<i>- Copy.</i>

989
01:06:01.064 --> 01:06:02.598
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:08.204 --> 01:06:09.372
What the hell?

991
01:06:10.608 --> 01:06:12.206
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:14.342
Flares!

993
01:06:14.344 --> 01:06:15.444
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:15.446 --> 01:06:16.647
Reload!

995
01:06:17.748 --> 01:06:19.481
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:30.393 --> 01:06:32.328
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:34.065 --> 01:06:36.167
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:51.514
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:06:53.217 --> 01:06:54.285
Where is it?

1000
01:07:01.293 --> 01:07:02.392
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:03.663 --> 01:07:04.795
Throw them!

1002
01:07:04.797 --> 01:07:06.328
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:18.643
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:18.645 --> 01:07:19.710
Above!

1005
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:26.184
There he is!

1006
01:07:30.823 --> 01:07:32.258
Move, move, move!

1007
01:08:02.222 --> 01:08:03.922
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:10.297 --> 01:08:11.798
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.632
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:16.301
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:16.303 --> 01:08:18.771
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:18.773 --> 01:08:20.372
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:22.809
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:22.811 --> 01:08:25.513
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:27.882 --> 01:08:30.585
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:35.355
Right now.

1017
01:08:38.561 --> 01:08:41.359
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:42.430
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:47.603
- In the back.
<i>- I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:08:54.677 --> 01:08:56.779
I'm out of control.

1021
01:08:58.447 --> 01:08:59.948
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:01.784
<i>- No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:03.986
What? Why?

1024
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.319
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:11.659
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:14.462
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:14.464 --> 01:09:17.033
- Not all sounds.
<i>- And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:20.302
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:21.905 --> 01:09:23.339
Always.

1030
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:26.609
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:26.611 --> 01:09:29.309
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:29.311 --> 01:09:31.613
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:34.952
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:36.254 --> 01:09:37.952
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:37.954 --> 01:09:40.422
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:40.424 --> 01:09:43.027
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.732
Annie.

1038
01:09:50.734 --> 01:09:54.402
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:09:54.404 --> 01:10:00.408
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:02.013
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.483
And that I love you.

1042
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:08.684
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:08.686 --> 01:10:11.788
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.424
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:22.532
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:22.534 --> 01:10:25.735
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:25.737 --> 01:10:26.805
Thank you.

1048
01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:46.459
Hello?

1049
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.006
What are you doing here?

1050
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:03.711
Are you lost?

1051
01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:07.881
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:15.456 --> 01:11:16.955
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:20.459
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:23.129
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:25.864
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:27.167
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.734
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:32.639
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:34.573
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:34.575 --> 01:11:36.775
- This parasite, whatever this is...
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:36.777 --> 01:11:38.076
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:38.078 --> 01:11:39.712
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:41.814
- You're using him up.
<i>- No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:41.816 --> 01:11:44.850
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:44.852 --> 01:11:47.452
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
<i>- No!</i>

1066
01:11:47.454 --> 01:11:49.055
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:49.057 --> 01:11:50.523
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:50.525 --> 01:11:52.090
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:11:52.092 --> 01:11:53.652
- Oh, God!
<i>- We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:11:54.963 --> 01:11:56.029
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:11:56.031 --> 01:11:57.191
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:02.737
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.954
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:20.956 --> 01:12:22.224
What is that?

1075
01:12:29.198 --> 01:12:32.166
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:32.168 --> 01:12:35.237
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:37.073 --> 01:12:41.744
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:42.979 --> 01:12:44.113
We're done.

1079
01:12:46.482 --> 01:12:48.850
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:50.618
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.700
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:12:55.558 --> 01:12:57.092
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:12:57.094 --> 01:13:00.996
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:13:00.998 --> 01:13:03.231
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:13:03.233 --> 01:13:06.202
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:13:06.204 --> 01:13:09.938
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.673
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:11.675 --> 01:13:13.808
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.078
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:18.883 --> 01:13:19.883
Dan.

1091
01:13:26.723 --> 01:13:27.958
Where is it?

1092
01:13:53.886 --> 01:13:55.888
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:22.014 --> 01:14:25.715
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:25.717 --> 01:14:30.320
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:30.322 --> 01:14:34.360
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:34.594 --> 01:14:36.894
Whoo!

1097
01:14:38.566 --> 01:14:42.234
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:14:51.812 --> 01:14:53.879
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:14:53.881 --> 01:14:56.914
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:14:56.916 --> 01:15:00.819
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:02.753
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:04.223
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:15:04.225 --> 01:15:05.991
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:15:05.993 --> 01:15:09.161
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:09.163 --> 01:15:11.730
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:11.732 --> 01:15:13.165
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:15.702
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:15.704 --> 01:15:17.703
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:17.705 --> 01:15:19.374
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:19.608 --> 01:15:23.308
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.111
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:27.047 --> 01:15:29.314
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.818
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:36.322
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:38.758
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.327
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:44.397
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:44.399 --> 01:15:47.800
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:47.802 --> 01:15:49.102
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:49.104 --> 01:15:51.705
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:15:51.707 --> 01:15:53.107
that they're killing you.

1122
01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:54.841
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:15:54.843 --> 01:15:57.378
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.914
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:01.418
Where's Venom?

1126
01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:05.218
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:11.294 --> 01:16:15.095
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:15.097 --> 01:16:17.765
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:17.767 --> 01:16:22.002
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:30.247 --> 01:16:35.453
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:35.687 --> 01:16:39.087
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:39.089 --> 01:16:41.291
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:43.327 --> 01:16:45.093
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:45.095 --> 01:16:46.828
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:50.100
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:51.469 --> 01:16:53.037
I can take care of that.

1137
01:16:58.075 --> 01:17:01.077
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:17:01.079 --> 01:17:02.080
Shut up.

1139
01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:07.519
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:12.424 --> 01:17:14.092
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:16.996 --> 01:17:18.462
God damn it!

1142
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:23.500
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:23.502 --> 01:17:25.503
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:25.505 --> 01:17:27.270
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:28.472
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:31.509
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:31.511 --> 01:17:36.015
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:38.384 --> 01:17:40.217
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:40.219 --> 01:17:41.454
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:43.188 --> 01:17:45.190
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:49.895 --> 01:17:50.961
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:50.963 --> 01:17:52.997
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:17:52.999 --> 01:17:55.832
Oh...

1154
01:17:55.834 --> 01:17:56.835
Mmm...

1155
01:17:57.871 --> 01:17:59.072
Mmm!

1156
01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:16.490
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:18.091 --> 01:18:20.492
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:22.995
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:25.599
<i>- The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:25.832 --> 01:18:28.333
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:28.335 --> 01:18:30.401
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:30.403 --> 01:18:32.724
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
<i>- He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:32.839 --> 01:18:34.405
- Oh, great.
<i>- We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:34.407 --> 01:18:36.108
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:37.544
- Well, I'm coming with you.
<i>- No!</i>

1166
01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.446
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.928
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:43.317 --> 01:18:44.885
Not today.

1169
01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.955
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:50.124 --> 01:18:51.626
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.026
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:56.464
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:18:56.466 --> 01:18:58.197
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:18:58.199 --> 01:18:59.899
How long?

1175
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.601
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:04.973
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:08.310
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:15.248
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.217
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.621
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:22.255
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:26.628
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:28.870
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.598
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.366
- on a whole planet?
<i>- Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.569
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:34.571 --> 01:19:37.138
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.173
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.679
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:44.646
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:44.648 --> 01:19:47.314
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.950
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.690
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.056
- then it's back to "we."
<i>- It is "we."</i>

1195
01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:58.460
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:19:58.462 --> 01:20:00.162
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:20:00.164 --> 01:20:01.645
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:20:05.436 --> 01:20:08.405
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:10.407 --> 01:20:13.074
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:13.076 --> 01:20:15.447
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:22.152 --> 01:20:25.220
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:25.222 --> 01:20:27.559
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:41.640
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:51.216 --> 01:20:54.152
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:21:01.627 --> 01:21:05.394
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:21:05.396 --> 01:21:08.097
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:08.099 --> 01:21:10.199
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:13.637
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:13.639 --> 01:21:16.543
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:19.546 --> 01:21:21.648
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:28.153
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:31.425 --> 01:21:34.258
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.396
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:38.398 --> 01:21:39.732
Then die.

1215
01:21:50.478 --> 01:21:52.478
<i>- Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.114
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:22:06.561 --> 01:22:08.094
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:11.699
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:50.473 --> 01:22:53.205
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:56.546
Eddie.

1221
01:23:01.084 --> 01:23:02.452
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:08.721 --> 01:24:11.189
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:18.329 --> 01:24:20.633
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:38.618 --> 01:24:40.316
You're too late.

1225
01:24:40.318 --> 01:24:41.319
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:43.389 --> 01:24:45.625
You talk too much.

1227
01:24:55.234 --> 01:24:56.969
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:24:57.204 --> 01:24:58.839
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:28.803
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:30.705
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:31.539 --> 01:25:32.607
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:34.542
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:35.308 --> 01:25:36.309
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:36.844 --> 01:25:37.879
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.311
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:40.313 --> 01:25:41.847
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:41.849 --> 01:25:43.716
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:43.718 --> 01:25:45.721
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:47.522 --> 01:25:48.689
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:25:56.031 --> 01:25:57.664
Traitor!

1241
01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:59.433
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:27.095
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:28.363 --> 01:26:29.799
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:17.848 --> 01:27:21.818
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1245
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.418
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1246
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.156
I feel great. Awesome.

1247
01:27:25.389 --> 01:27:27.157
Wow.

1248
01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:29.058
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1249
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:32.562
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1250
01:27:32.564 --> 01:27:34.564
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1251
01:27:34.566 --> 01:27:36.531
You're a good person, Annie.

1252
01:27:36.533 --> 01:27:38.034
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:27:38.036 --> 01:27:39.869
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1254
01:27:39.871 --> 01:27:41.905
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1255
01:27:41.907 --> 01:27:44.007
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1256
01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:48.445
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1257
01:27:48.447 --> 01:27:50.547
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1258
01:27:50.549 --> 01:27:52.883
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1259
01:27:52.885 --> 01:27:55.519
Oh! Like everyone else.

1260
01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.522
Yeah.

1261
01:27:58.958 --> 01:28:01.193
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1262
01:28:02.894 --> 01:28:04.095
Hey, um...

1263
01:28:06.766 --> 01:28:08.599
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1264
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:11.804
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1265
01:28:13.439 --> 01:28:17.175
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1266
01:28:17.177 --> 01:28:19.579
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1267
01:28:22.081 --> 01:28:24.451
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1268
01:28:25.084 --> 01:28:26.518
I mean, the...

1269
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.055
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1270
01:28:30.057 --> 01:28:31.623
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1271
01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:32.726
Okay.

1272
01:28:34.027 --> 01:28:35.627
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1273
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:37.862
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1274
01:28:37.864 --> 01:28:41.599
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1275
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:44.536
No, I don't think so.

1276
01:28:44.538 --> 01:28:47.005
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1277
01:28:47.007 --> 01:28:48.807
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1278
01:28:48.809 --> 01:28:51.211
- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1279
01:28:51.446 --> 01:28:52.979
Eddie, are you sure?

1280
01:28:52.981 --> 01:28:54.980
Good Lord, look at that.

1281
01:28:54.982 --> 01:28:57.117
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1282
01:28:58.886 --> 01:29:01.053
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:01.055 --> 01:29:03.190
You take care, all right?

1284
01:29:03.459 --> 01:29:05.259
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1285
01:29:09.197 --> 01:29:12.631
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1286
01:29:12.633 --> 01:29:13.801
Either of you.

1287
01:29:14.535 --> 01:29:15.901
We won't.

1288
01:29:15.903 --> 01:29:17.603
<i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1289
01:29:17.605 --> 01:29:20.172
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1290
01:29:20.174 --> 01:29:22.842
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1291
01:29:22.844 --> 01:29:25.778
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1292
01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.548
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1293
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:31.286
<i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1294
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.219
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1295
01:29:33.221 --> 01:29:36.790
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1296
01:29:36.792 --> 01:29:39.092
And then there are bad people.

1297
01:29:39.094 --> 01:29:40.961
You have to tell
the difference.

1298
01:29:40.963 --> 01:29:44.831
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1299
01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:48.201
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1300
01:29:48.203 --> 01:29:50.637
eat very, very bad people,

1301
01:29:50.639 --> 01:29:53.308
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1302
01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:55.909
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.

1303
01:29:55.911 --> 01:29:57.678
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1304
01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.780
Well, it's super simple.

1305
01:29:59.782 --> 01:30:02.683
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1306
01:30:02.685 --> 01:30:04.752
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1307
01:30:04.754 --> 01:30:06.187
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1308
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:08.256
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1309
01:30:08.258 --> 01:30:13.693
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1310
01:30:13.695 --> 01:30:15.999
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1311
01:30:17.567 --> 01:30:19.869
Hey, Mrs. C.

1312
01:30:20.937 --> 01:30:22.637
How you doing, Eddie?

1313
01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:24.206
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1314
01:30:24.208 --> 01:30:27.175
No.

1315
01:30:27.177 --> 01:30:30.314
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1316
01:30:30.548 --> 01:30:32.213
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1317
01:30:32.215 --> 01:30:33.882
Right. Okay, no problem.

1318
01:30:35.152 --> 01:30:36.719
The payment's due, Chen.

1319
01:30:38.222 --> 01:30:40.221
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1320
01:30:40.223 --> 01:30:41.790
Now.

1321
01:30:41.792 --> 01:30:43.360
<i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1322
01:30:50.901 --> 01:30:52.968
You come in here again...

1323
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:57.639
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1324
01:30:57.641 --> 01:31:01.143
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1325
01:31:01.145 --> 01:31:03.145
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1326
01:31:03.147 --> 01:31:06.216
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1327
01:31:06.218 --> 01:31:08.118
- Please...
- Yes.

1328
01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:12.021
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1329
01:31:12.023 --> 01:31:16.793
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1330
01:31:16.795 --> 01:31:19.164
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1331
01:31:21.066 --> 01:31:23.635
We are Venom.

1332
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:27.239
- On second thought...
- Please.

1333
01:31:34.312 --> 01:31:36.713
Eddie? What was that?

1334
01:31:36.715 --> 01:31:38.114
Oh...

1335
01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:41.921
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1336
01:31:43.256 --> 01:31:44.788
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:46.790
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1338
01:31:46.792 --> 01:31:48.792
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.

1339
01:31:48.794 --> 01:31:51.729
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1340
01:31:51.731 --> 01:31:54.435
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1341
01:31:54.667 --> 01:31:58.802
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1342
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:28.023
I need you
to stay quiet.

1343
01:34:28.025 --> 01:34:30.993
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1344
01:34:30.995 --> 01:34:34.131
- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1345
01:34:38.471 --> 01:34:40.036
Open on five.

1346
01:34:40.038 --> 01:34:43.173
Go. Opening up.

1347
01:34:45.242 --> 01:34:47.944
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1348
01:34:47.946 --> 01:34:50.481
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1349
01:34:50.483 --> 01:34:52.214
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1350
01:34:52.216 --> 01:34:54.384
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1351
01:34:54.386 --> 01:34:57.020
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1352
01:34:57.022 --> 01:35:00.156
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1353
01:35:00.158 --> 01:35:03.596
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1354
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:07.299
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1355
01:35:10.369 --> 01:35:13.272
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1356
01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:36.060
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1357
01:35:36.062 --> 01:35:40.499
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1358
01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.668
Sure, it's good with me.

1359
01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:44.235
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1360
01:35:44.237 --> 01:35:51.108
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1361
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:53.178
I bet you can.

1362
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.650
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1363
01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:57.519
Come on over.

1364
01:35:58.486 --> 01:35:59.953
All right.

1365
01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.291
I'm here.

1366
01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:10.029
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1367
01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:13.334
there's gonna be carnage.
